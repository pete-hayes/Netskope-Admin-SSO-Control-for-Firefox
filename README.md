# Netskope Admin SSO Control for Firefox
A Mozilla Firefox extension that manages and controls automatic redirection to Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Netskope Administrator Portal.

## Known Issues
- The extension cannot currently handle directly accessing a non-login page for the Netskope Administrator Portal, e.g., clicking a saved bookmark for **Advanced Analytics** will still redirect to SSO.
