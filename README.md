# Netskope Admin SSO Control for Firefox
A Mozilla Firefox extension that manages and controls automatic redirection to Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Netskope Administrator Portal.

This extension is particularly useful for administrators who manage multiple Netskope tenants. It prevents automatic redirection to SSO, allowing login with a local administrator account instead. Users can configure which tenants should redirect to SSO and which should open the local account login page (`https://example.goskope.com/locallogin`).

## Usage
1. Download and install the [Firefox extension](Netskope%20Admin%20Portal%20SSO%20Control.xpi).  
2. Visit a Netskope Administrator Portal with SSO enabled. The extension will automatically redirect you to the local login page instead of initiating the SSO process.  

If youâ€™d like to allow SSO redirection for specific tenants, you can add exceptions in either of the following ways:  
- Click the extension icon and manually add the Netskope tenant FQDN as an exception.  
- While viewing the Netskope Administrator Portal in the active browser tab, click the extension icon and select **Add Current FQDN and Refresh**.

## Known Issues
- The extension cannot currently handle directly accessing a non-login page for the Netskope Administrator Portal, e.g., clicking a saved bookmark for **Advanced Analytics** will still redirect to SSO.
